# Development handoff — 0.1.1

Published candidate source commit: `8a64cb4e985702150e1d9f2169a80e71239a71d8`.
Publication and independent download verification passed in run `41146391540`.

0.1.0 reached the menu and Create-a-Sim on the Thor but had white backgrounds,
missing hair/eyes, and a stalled swipe tutorial. No gameplay/save gate passed.
0.1.1 adds software PVRTC support, the existing Snapdragon alpha configuration,
indexed/cancel-safe touch dispatch, and a resume lost-wake correction.

Next meaningful gate: install over 0.1.0; verify menu/room/hair/eyes; swipe across
the Sim and advance the tutorial; enter the house; check audio/touch and save/
reload. Do not claim these have passed until the user provides results.

Diagnostics: app icon opens CompatActivity in :launcher and its own reports
task; Start game enters GameBootActivity in the main process, bootstraps JNI,
and opens original Main. A Report button is attached after every game view
replacement. If game UI blocks, Home -> app icon -> Share diagnostics accesses
persisted logs independently. Do not auto-start the game from the launcher.

Native log includes GL renderer/extensions, bounded upload/errors, and mapping
addresses. Java log includes touch arrivals, returned swap/canvas frame counts,
UI heartbeat age and stalled thread snapshots. A returned swap is not proof of
successful frame presentation. Native callbacks remain synchronous.

ARM32 support, 4 KiB pages, and target SDK 28 remain deliberate constraints.
Dedicated S3E code mappings remain RWX. Do not raise target or advertise ARM64/
16 KiB support without new runtime work and device validation.

The exact original APK is required to rebuild. Keep the signing key from the
separately saved private S3CE-private-signing-backup.zip for install-over updates;
never commit it or its configuration/password. App ID and original Java/JNI
class names must be preserved.

New release publication uses pack_release_delta.py plus assemble_release.py:
unchanged ZIP data is copied from the hash-pinned published 0.1.0 APK and changed
bytes are staged as a small literal payload. Reconstruction must match the
signed new APK hash exactly. Full installable APKs are published to Releases.
See VALIDATION.md, native/README.md, and patches/README.md for precise test scope.
